            <p className="text-md text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                KhmerLingo was created to make learning the Khmer language more approachable, practical, and fun ‚Äî especially
                for second-generation Cambodians and language lovers around the world. We know that for many, learning Khmer
                isn&apos;t just about grammar and vocabulary ‚Äî it&apos;s about reconnecting with your roots, honoring your
                family, or building a bridge to a culture you care about.
            </p>

            <p className="text-md text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Our lessons are designed to meet you where you are ‚Äî whether you&apos;re starting with the alphabet or diving
                deep into advanced grammar, literary registers, or public speaking. We blend language learning with cultural
                insight so you&apos;re not just learning how to speak Khmer ‚Äî you&apos;re learning how to use it with confidence
                and respect.
            </p>
